# Managing Communities Through Expectations

*Musings on building communities that last.*

## Disclaimer

The views expressed here are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the communities I am part of. Some ideas may sound obvious, others uncomfortable. My hope is not that you agree with everything, but that you sit with it for a while and decide what resonates.

## About Me, and Why I Care

I am a programmer, biomedical engineer, open-source contributor, technical Minecraft player, and medical student in the United States. My interests are varied, but they share a common thread: **having fun by building things with other people**.

Over the years I’ve helped start and run several online communities, including open-source projects, technical Discord servers, and long-running Minecraft archives. Some of these worked. Some failed. Most taught me lessons the hard way.

I care about communities because they are force multipliers. Learning, creativity, and problem-solving all accelerate when people feel aligned, supported, and respected. When communities fail, it’s rarely due to a lack of talent—it’s usually because expectations drift, communication degrades, or volunteers burn out.

This essay distills what I’ve learned trying (and often failing) to prevent that.

## What Makes a Good Community?

A good community is one that is **enjoyable to participate in**.

That sounds trivial. It isn’t.

In practice, I’ve found that healthy communities consistently rely on three pillars:

1. **Good expectations**
2. **High-quality communication and feedback**
3. **Sacrifice—managed sustainably**

Everything else—rules, tools, leadership structures—exists to support these.

## Expectations: The Core Primitive

If I had to pick one thing that matters more than anything else in community management, it would be **expectations**.

By expectations, I don’t mean a long list of rules. I mean a shared understanding of:

* what the community is for,
* how people are expected to behave,
* and what members can expect from one another.

Sociology calls these *norms*. I prefer *expectations* because the term is intuitive and actionable.

Expectations shape behavior more powerfully than enforcement ever will. The same group of people will behave completely differently in a Minecraft Discord than they would in a church, courtroom, or workplace—not because the people changed, but because the expectations did.

Expectations set the culture.

Think of a community as an orchestra. Expectations are the sheet music. When everyone is playing from the same score, the result is coherent and enjoyable. When they aren’t, you get noise.

Every decision a community leader makes either reinforces, undermines, or reshapes expectations—whether intentionally or not.

---

## Understanding Existing Expectations

Before changing expectations, you must understand the ones that already exist.

Never assume alignment. Online especially, it’s easy to misread intent, tone, or motivation.

> *Meten is weten* — “To measure is to know.”

Surveys, interviews, and structured discussions are invaluable here. Even simple pre-join questionnaires can reveal whether new members expect:

* mentorship or independence,
* casual discussion or high technical rigor,
* socializing or productivity.

Quantitative data is especially useful. Tracking trends over time—such as shifts in expertise level after advertising in new places—can reveal when expectations are drifting faster than the community can absorb.

Growth, in particular, is an expectation-shaping force. Where you advertise determines who you attract, and who you attract determines what the community becomes.

---

## Identifying Desired Expectations

Once you understand what people *expect*, the next step is deciding what expectations the community *should* have.

This should not be done in isolation. Involving invested members improves buy-in and surfaces blind spots. That said, popularity alone is not a sufficient criterion.

Desired expectations must be:

* achievable with available resources,
* aligned with the community’s purpose,
* sustainable for the people doing the work.

Sometimes this means suppressing expectations—even popular ones—that the community cannot realistically support.

High standards without sufficient capacity don’t produce excellence; they produce burnout.

---

## Setting and Maintaining Expectations

You will not get expectations right on the first try. This is an iterative process.

Ways to communicate and reinforce expectations include:

* clear mission statements,
* role definitions with explicit responsibilities,
* recognition for behavior that embodies community values,
* consequences for behavior that undermines them.

Not all expectations need to be public or formalized. Some are contextual, nuanced, or best understood by those in leadership roles. Transparency matters, but so does discretion.

The key is consistency. Inconsistent enforcement erodes expectations faster than no enforcement at all.

---

## High-Quality Communication and Feedback

Strong expectations mean little without strong communication.

Healthy communities create environments where people feel safe giving feedback—and where leaders are capable of hearing it.

### Embracing Criticism

If you manage a community, you must be able to take a punch.

Behind most complaints—even poorly delivered ones—there is often useful information. Separating that signal from emotional noise is a learned skill.

This does not mean tolerating abuse or abandoning boundaries. It means detaching ego from leadership. The goal is not to defend pride; it’s to improve the system.

Anonymous feedback channels, one-on-one conversations, and simply asking for input all help lower the barrier to honesty.

---

### Selective Listening

Listening does not mean acting on everything you hear.

All feedback should be considered, but not all feedback should be weighted equally. Investment matters. Long-term contributors, volunteers, and people who consistently improve the community tend to have better context and stronger incentives for its success.

Ignoring feedback should be a deliberate choice, not a reflex—but choosing *which* feedback to prioritize is part of leadership.

This is uncomfortable, but unavoidable.

---

### Improving Signal-to-Noise Ratio

As communities grow, communication volume can become overwhelming. Poor signal-to-noise ratios exhaust both leaders and members.

Practical mitigations include:

* topic-specific channels with enforced scope,
* barriers to entry that filter out low-intent participation,
* splitting large communities into smaller, semi-autonomous groups.

The goal is not silence—it’s clarity.

---

## Sacrifice, and How Not to Burn Out Your Volunteers

Every functioning community relies on people willing to sacrifice time and energy with little immediate reward.

Moderators, maintainers, reviewers, and organizers do the work that keeps everything else possible.

These people should be:

* treated with respect,
* listened to carefully,
* and protected from unsustainable workloads.

Sacrifice is necessary. Exploitation is not.

Automation, delegation, and clear scope boundaries are not luxuries—they are burnout prevention tools. The longer a community plans to exist, the earlier it should invest in them.

Be kind to your future volunteers. Better yet, make their jobs easier than your own was.

---

## Designing for Sustainability

The most important question in community design is not *“Does this work?”* but *“Will this still work in two years?”*

Systems that rely on heroics, institutional memory, or a single irreplaceable person will eventually fail. People leave. Energy fluctuates. Life happens.

Design for turnover. Design for fatigue. Design for imperfect humans.

Healthy communities outlive individuals—not because leaders cling to power, but because systems allow leadership to change without collapse.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Communities are long-term endeavors. Most conflicts burn out faster than the communities themselves—if you build systems that can endure them.

Set expectations deliberately. Communicate honestly. Respect sacrifice. Default to kindness, but don’t avoid hard decisions.

And remember: the goal is not control. The goal is to create a space people *want* to be part of.

If you get that right, most problems solve themselves.
